  <Heading level={1}>Having Your Home Business Network And Building It</Heading>
  <Txt>
    Once you have a home business going, you still have the most important job
    of all to accomplish. The job of building your network of customers and/or
    clients. Without a network of contacts, you will not have any reason to have
    a business, will you? It doesn’t matter what kind of business you have
    chosen because in every business, whether it’s a product or service, there
    is a need for customers/clients. There is no business, online or off, that
    can survive without the benefit of networking. Even if you are a service
    provider of a creative nature, you need to network to assure that you will
    constantly have those who are interested in buying what you create.
