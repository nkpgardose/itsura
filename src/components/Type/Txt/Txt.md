  Okay, you’ve bought the ATV, now it’s time to get it home. Unfortunately, you can’t ride your ATV down the street, so you’re going to have to purchase an ATV trailer to get it there, and to your fun destinations.

  Buying an ATV trailer takes some homework, and some things will need to be done before you decide on and purchase any particular trailer. One of the first things to do is make sure your vehicle is able to pull the extra weight of a trailer with one, two or three ATV’s loaded onto it. Then, you’ll need to attach a trailer hitch to your vehicle. Learning how to pull, turn and drive your trailer in various terrains and surfaces is a good idea as well.

  Most people can purchase an ATV trailer at the lot where ATV’s and campers and other outdoor vehicles are sold, or you may opt to find a trailer yard in your community. Make sure that any trailer you purchase, whether new or used, works correctly and has good tires. Make sure also that wheel bearings are in good working order and check them at least once a year to make sure they stay that way
